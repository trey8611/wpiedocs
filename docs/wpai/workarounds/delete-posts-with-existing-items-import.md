#### Requirements

Your import file must only contain the posts that you want to delete from your site, and it must contain a value that you can use to find the existing posts using Manual Record Matching: http://www.wpallimport.com/documentation/recurring/manual-record-matching/.

#### Steps

- Upload your file to a new import and select "Existing Items" on step 1: https://d.pr/evjI9j.
- On step 3, set the "Post Status" to "trash" inside the "Other Post Options" section: https://d.pr/FREE/fhvvQO.
- On step 4, choose to only update the post status: https://d.pr/7VVLu9.

Now, run the import and it will put all of the matched posts into the trash bin.
